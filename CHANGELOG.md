# Changelog

All notable product-facing changes to `prtr` are documented in this file.

## v0.4.2 - 2026-03-15

### Highlights

- Added `prtr doctor --fix` for safe automatic repair when possible.
- Introduced a platform matrix summary for doctor output.
- Improved recovery guidance for clipboard, launcher, paste, and translation failures.

### Why This Release Matters

`v0.4.2` moves `doctor` from a pure diagnostics screen toward an actual recovery surface. It still stays honest about what can and cannot be repaired automatically, but it now helps users get unstuck faster.

### Product Value

- Better repair guidance
- Clearer platform readiness visibility
- Faster recovery from setup and delivery failures

## v0.4.1 - 2026-03-15

### Highlights

- Added `prtr start` as the beginner-first entry for onboarding and the first real send.
- Repositioned `setup` as the advanced compatibility flow for full defaults configuration.
- Hardened release automation with full git history and structured GoReleaser release notes.

### Why This Release Matters

`v0.4.1` makes the first-run path easier to explain and easier to succeed with. New users now have one front door for setup, doctor, and the first send, while advanced users can still use `setup` when they want deeper control over defaults.

### Product Value

- Clearer first-run activation
- Better separation between beginner and advanced configuration
- Stronger release packaging and changelog generation
